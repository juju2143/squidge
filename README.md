# Yuki's Small, Quick and Dirty Game Engine (SQuiDGE)

A simple game engine based on SDL 2.0 and QuickJS.

*Warning: Here be dragons. This is alpha software, this might as well be full of bugs, the code might be unreadable and/or the API can change at any time. You've been warned.*

## Features

- based on QuickJS
- Should work anywhere SDL is supported, which is basically anywhere
- ES2020 compliant
- extensible, small and fast
- easy to use API
- can compile your script into a distributable binary
- just a collection of libraries for QuickJS to make gamedev easier, really

## Compile and run

Make sure you have a copy of QuickJS and SDL2 installed and just type `make`, you'll get a .so file you can import with QuickJS.
